			<h4>
				<br> Here are a few things about Freddie's career: <br> <br>
			</h4>
			<h5>Singer</h5>
			<p>Although Mercury's speaking voice naturally fell in the
				baritone range, he delivered most songs in the tenor range. His
				known vocal range extended from bass low F (F2) to soprano high F
				(F6). He could belt up to tenor high F (F5). Biographer David Bret
				described his voice as "escalating within a few bars from a deep,
				throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a
				high-pitched, perfect coloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper
				reaches. "Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury
				recorded an album, expressed her opinion that "the difference
				between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was
				selling the voice". She adds,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<em> "His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he
					sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very
					good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to
					another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle,
					delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find
					the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word." </em>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey called Mercury "the best
				virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in
				any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God,
				that's an art. And he was brilliant at it. "A research team
				undertook a study in 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's
				voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team noted his notably
				faster vibrato and use of subharmonics, particularly in comparison
				to opera singers. The research team studied vocal samples from 23
				commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, and a series
				of interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video
				camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's
				singing voice.</p>

			<h5>Songwriter</h5>

			<p>Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen's Greatest Hits
				album: "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Seven Seas of Rhye", "Killer Queen",
				"Somebody to Love", "Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy", "We Are the
				Champions", "Bicycle Race", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing
				Called Love" and "Play the Game".</p>
			<p>The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide
				range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles,
				rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he
				explained in a 1986 interview, "I hate doing the same thing again
				and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music,
				film and theatre and incorporate all of those things. "Compared to
				many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically
				complex material. For example, "Bohemian Rhapsody" is acyclic in
				structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs
				from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex
				material. "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand,
				contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often
				wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely
				read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide
				variety of different key signatures.</p>

			<h5>Live performer</h5>

			<p>Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often
				delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a
				highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of
				participation from the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described
				him as "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his
				audience with various extravagant versions of himself. "David Bowie,
				who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded
				the song "Under Pressure" with Queen, praised Mercury's performance
				style, saying: "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie
				took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of
				course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in
				concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold
				an audience in the palm of his hand. "Queen guitarist Brian May
				wrote that Mercury could make "the last person at the back of the
				furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected".</p>
			<p>One of Mercury's most notable performances with Queen took
				place at Live Aid in 1985, during which the entire stadium audience
				of 72,000 people clapped, sang and swayed in unison. Queen's
				performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music
				executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock
				music. The results were aired on a television program called "The
				World's Greatest Gigs". Mercury's powerful, sustained note during
				the a cappella section came to be known as "The Note Heard Round the
				World". In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, "Those who
				compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots to Mick
				Jagger, Robert Plant, etc all are guilty of a terrible oversight.
				Freddie, as evidenced by his Dionysian Live Aid performance, was
				easily the most godlike of them all."</p>
			<p>Over the course of his career, Mercury performed an estimated
				700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen. A notable
				aspect of Queen concerts was the large scale involved.[40] He once
				explained, "We're the Cecil B. DeMille of rock and roll, always
				wanting to do things bigger and better. "The band was the first ever
				to play in South American stadiums, breaking worldwide records for
				concert attendance in the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo in 1981. In
				1986, Queen also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed
				to a crowd of 80,000 in Budapest, in what was one of the biggest
				rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe. Mercury's final live
				performance with Queen took place on 9 August 1986 at Knebworth Park
				in England and drew an attendance estimated as high as 160,000. With
				the British national anthem "God Save the Queen" playing at the end
				of the concert, Mercury's final act on stage saw him draped in a
				robe, holding a golden crown aloft, bidding farewell to the crowd.</p>

			<h5>Instrumentalist</h5>

			<p>As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano
				training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he
				learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his
				favourite artists at the time were The Who, The Beatles, Jimi
				Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often
				self-deprecating about his own skills on both instruments and from
				the early 1980s onward began extensively using guest keyboardists
				for both Queen and his solo career. Most notably, he enlisted Fred
				Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton
				John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985
				onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney
				(in concert).</p>
			<p>Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular
				songs, including "Killer Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Good Old
				Fashioned Lover Boy", "We Are the Champions", "Somebody To Love" and
				"Don't Stop Me Now". He used concert grand pianos and, occasionally,
				other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord. From 1980
				onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio.
				Queen guitarist Brian May claims that Mercury was unimpressed with
				his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over
				time because he wanted to walk around onstage and entertain the
				audience. Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury
				possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like
				"Ogre Battle" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" were composed on
				the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar both
				onstage and in the studio.</p>

			<h5>Solo career</h5>

			<p>In addition to his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo
				albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as
				commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen
				albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the UK
				Music Charts. His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the
				pseudonym Larry Lurex, when Trident Studios' house engineer Robin
				Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when
				Queen were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to
				perform lead vocals on the songs "I Can Hear Music" and "Goin'
				Back", both were released together as a single in 1973; it reached
				the 115 position on the US Bubbling Under The Hot 100 chart. Eleven
				years later, Mercury made a contribution to the Richard "Wolfie"
				Wolf mix of Love Kills on the 1984 album (the song also used as the
				end title theme for National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1) and new
				soundtrack to the 1927 Fritz Lang film Metropolis. The song, written
				by Giorgio Moroder in collaboration with Mercury, debuted at the
				number 10 position in the UK charts. It was produced by Moroder and
				Mack. Mack also produced the 1987 single "Hold On" which Mercury
				recorded with actress Jo Dare for a German action drama Zabou.</p>
			<p>Mercury's two full albums outside the band were Mr. Bad Guy
				(1985) and Barcelona (1988). Mr. Bad Guy debuted in the top ten of
				the UK Album Charts. In 1993, a remix of "Living on My Own", a
				single from the album, posthumously reached number one on the UK
				Singles Charts. The song also garnered Mercury a posthumous Ivor
				Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and
				Authors. Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes Mr. Bad Guy as
				"outstanding from start to finish" and expressed his view that
				Mercury "did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted
				territory". In particular, the album is heavily synthesiser-driven
				in a way that is not characteristic of previous Queen albums.</p>
			<p>His second album, Barcelona, recorded with Spanish soprano
				Montserrat Caballé, combines elements of popular music and opera.
				Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred
				to it as "the most bizarre CD of the year". The album was a
				commercial success, and the album's title track debuted at No. 8 in
				the UK and was also a hit in Spain.[65] The title track received
				massive air play as the official anthem of the 1992 Summer Olympics
				(held in Barcelona one year after Mercury's death). Caballé sang it
				live at the opening of the Olympics with Mercury's part played on a
				screen, and again prior to the start of the 1999 UEFA Champions
				League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich in
				Barcelona.</p>
			<p>In addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several
				singles, including his own version of the hit "The Great Pretender"
				by The Platters, which debuted at No. 5 in the UK in 1987. In
				September 2006 a compilation album featuring Mercury's solo work was
				released in the UK in honour of what would have been his 60th
				birthday. The album debuted in the UK top 10.</p>
			<p>In 1981–1983 Mercury recorded several tracks with Michael
				Jackson, including a demo of "State of Shock", "Victory" and "There
				Must Be More to Life Than This". None of these collaborations were
				officially released at the time, although bootleg recordings exist.
				Jackson went on to record the single "State of Shock" with Mick
				Jagger for The Jacksons' album Victory. Mercury included the solo
				version of "There Must Be More To Life Than This" on his Mr. Bad Guy
				album. "There Must Be More to Life Than This" was eventually
				reworked by Queen and released on their compilation album Queen
				Forever in 2014.</p>
			<p>In addition to working with Michael Jackson, Mercury and Roger
				Taylor sang on the title track for Billy Squier's 1982 studio
				release, Emotions in Motion and later contributed to two tracks on
				Squier's 1986 release, Enough Is Enough, providing vocals on "Love
				is the Hero" and musical arrangements on "Lady With a Tenor Sax".</p>
